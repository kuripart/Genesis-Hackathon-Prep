Ideas for Hackathon:
1) Analytics => System with Login; Reporting system on Successful logins, etc. Suspicious activity, analyze data and send it to other users and managers; use plots etc (can do in Python); can use networking and caching; Firebase for Login page management/authentication!
             => Web-browsing analytics => sites visited, time-sharing, browsing-sequence, idling/stalling time.
             => Keystroke analysis and typing assistance.
2) Modelling/Simulation => 


3) Animation => Scripts to do animation on Blender!!!

4) Web Scrapping => https://github.com/kuripart/web_scraping_py

5) Use Django for UI/Web Services
