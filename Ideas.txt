1) Analytics => System with Login; Reporting system on Successful logins, etc. Suspicious activity, analyze data and send it to other users
                and managers; use plots etc (can do in Python); can use networking and caching.
             => Web-browsing analytics => sites visited, time-sharing, browsing-sequence, idling/stalling time.
             => Keystroke analysis and typing assistance.
2) Modelling/Simulation => 


3) Animation => Scripts to do animation on Blender!!!
